First - Identify the Product Brand. This can be found in the upper left corner and will say one of the following brands:

Enbrighten-GE | Honeywell | UltraPro

Second - Identify your ZW Number. This can be found on the device itself, typically on the upper corner or back of the product itself.

Finally - Identify your Product Number. These are typically on the back of the device in question followed by "-x" (ex: 46201-2 or 55256-1).
These will not be 5 digits next to "PIN:". The Pin number is for Z-Wave S2 Security inclusion.

The folder structure for firmware is as follows:

Navigate to the correct section based on the ZW Number and Brand of your device, and the firmware version you wish to download.

PLEASE NOTE: Downloading and applying the wrong firmware can cause irreperable damage to your device. Application of incorrect firmware will void the warranty on your device. Please make sure you are getting the correct product, brand, and version number for your use case.
