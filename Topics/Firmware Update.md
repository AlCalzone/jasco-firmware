## Firmware Updates

Wi-Fi products currently require the use of our app to update the firmware.

If you have an Enbrighten, UltraPro, or other Jasco branded device, please use the appropriate app to deploy the latest firmware to your device. 

For exact instructions on how to update your firmware, please review the documentation outlining this process for your specific home automation hub/system. Documentation must be provided by the support staff for the home automation hub/system in question. Some hubs and systems do not currently offer OTA updates, and any requested functionality to do so should be directed to the support for those specific systems.

Home Assistant users must use the [ZWaveJS2MQTT application](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwavejs2mqtt/#/README) to apply firmware updates.
